Letter to a Friend

   Hi, Fred!
   How has your semester been? I’ve already been Spain for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally adapting to the culture. I’m also speaking the language more fluently.
   I am living with a very welcoming host family. I have my own private bedroom, but we eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together.  We have an extended weekend coming up, so a group of my friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It’s so easy and inexpensive to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
   I look forward to hearing from you soon.
   Best wishes, Patrick
