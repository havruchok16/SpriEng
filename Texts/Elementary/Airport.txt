Airport

   Travelling to far countries is always a thrilling and interesting adventure. Heading for the other end of the world, it’s impossible to go without such an aircraft as “a plane”. But before boarding a plane, one must book a seat in advance.
   You can buy tickets at ticket offices or book flights online. Moreover, don’t forget to get travel insurance.
   The tickets are on hand, the insurance is in a pocket, a suitcase is packed – it’s time to go to the airport. You should arrive at the airport two hours earlier.
   Thst’s it – it’s high time you boarded  a place. It will take off any moment. Bon voyage!
