At school

   Lucas goes to school every day of the week. He has many subjects to go to each school day: English, art and history. His mother packs a big backpack full of books and lunch for Lucas.
   His first class is English, and he likes that teacher very much. His English teacher says that he is a good pupil.
   His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. It is his favorite class.
   History is his last class of the day Lucas has a hard time staying awake.
