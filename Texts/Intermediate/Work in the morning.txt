Work in the morning

   My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I’m always in a rush.  At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive.
   I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. I always listen to my favorite classical music CD’s in the car – Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.
   The drive to work takes about one hour. Lately I’ve been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.
