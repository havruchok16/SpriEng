Amazon adventure

   Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk the length of the Amazon River. He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river’s mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres.
   On his trip, Ed had to find food to eat every day. A lot of the time, the fruit, nuts and fish he ate were hard to find and he often felt weak and exhausted.
   Ed’s walk would have been impossible without technology. He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land. As he walked Ed wrote a blog, recording his day-to-day experiences.
