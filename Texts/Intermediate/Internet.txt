Internet

Internet is a worldwide network that transmits data to different parts of the Earth. Owing to the internet, humanity has a chance to share information, download or transfer files, communicate in various chat rooms as well as learn the latest news in the split second.

Every year users in a network are not growing smaller. On the contrary, their number is increasing. Two thirds of Americans regularly use the internet. The second place has been taken by the Asian countries - China and Japan.

Internet is not only an entertaining place, but also a learning platform. Want to learn something - search the answer to your question on the internet. The answer won’t make you wait. Want to learn, for example, a foreign language – it’s all in your hands. Even higher education can be acquired via the World Wide Web. The only minus of the Internet is abundance of information. There is so much of it that at times you get lost in this web of communication.
